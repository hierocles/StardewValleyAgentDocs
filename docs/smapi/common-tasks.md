This page covers how to do common tasks in SMAPI mods. **Before reading
this page, see the
<a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_Get_Started" class="wikilink"
title="Modder Guide">Modder Guide</a> and
<a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_Game_Fundamentals" class="wikilink"
title="Game Fundamentals">Game Fundamentals</a>.**

## Basic techniques

### Tracking changes to a value

Mods often need to know when a value has changed. A common approach to
track changes to those values that do not have a SMAPI event is to
create a private
[field](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields)
to track it instead. This value should be updated using the update tick
event.

See <a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_APIs_Events#Change_monitoring"
class="wikilink"
title="Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Events#Change monitoring">Modding:Modder
Guide/APIs/Events#Change monitoring</a> for an example.

## Items

Items are objects which represent things which can be put in an
inventory, such as tools, crops, and ores.

### Create an item (Object)

All constructors for Object:

``` c#
 public Object(Vector2 tileLocation, int parentSheetIndex, int initialStack);
 public Object(Vector2 tileLocation, int parentSheetIndex, bool isRecipe = false);
 public Object(int parentSheetIndex, int initialStack, bool isRecipe = false, int price = -1, int quality = 0);
 public Object(Vector2 tileLocation, int parentSheetIndex, string Givenname, bool canBeSetDown, bool canBeGrabbed, bool isHoedirt, bool isSpawnedObject);
```

Where **parentSheetIndex** is the ID of the item (can be found in
ObjectInformation.xnb).

### Spawn an item on the ground

An item can be spawnedon the ground with the
`[[Modding_Modder_Guide_Game_Fundamentals#GameLocation_et_al|GameLocation]]`
class's `dropObject` method:

``` c#
 public virtual bool dropObject(Object obj, Vector2 dropLocation, xTile.Dimensions.Rectangle viewport, bool initialPlacement, Farmer who = null);

 // Concrete code for spawning:
 Game1.getLocationFromName("Farm").dropObject(new StardewValley.Object(itemId, 1, false, -1, 0), new Vector2(x, y) * 64f, Game1.viewport, true, (Farmer)null);
```

### Add an item to an inventory

``` c#
//You can add items found in ObjectInformation using:
    Game1.player.addItemByMenuIfNecessary((Item)new StardewValley.Object(int parentSheetIndex, int initialStack, [bool isRecipe = false], [int price = -1], [int quality = 0]));
```

Another example:

``` c#
    // Add a weapon directly into player's inventory
    const int WEAP_ID = 19;                  // Shadow Dagger -- see Data/weapons
    Item weapon = new MeleeWeapon(WEAP_ID);  // MeleeWeapon is a class in StardewValley.Tools
    Game1.player.addItemByMenuIfNecessary(weapon);

    // Note: This code WORKS.
```

### Remove an item from an inventory

This is dependent on the inventory. In most cases, this method is not
called directly as the game provides functions for the player in the
`Farmer` class (in the main namespace).

In most situations, this can be done by calling
`.removeItemFromInventory(Item)`.

## Locations

See <a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_Game_Fundamentals#GameLocation"
class="wikilink" title="Game Fundamentals#GameLocation">Game
Fundamentals#GameLocation</a>.

### Get all locations

The list of root locations is stored in `Game1.locations`, but
constructed building interiors aren't included. Instead, use the method
`Utility.ForAllLocations`

``` c#
Utility.ForAllLocations((GameLocation location) =>
{
   // do things with location here.
});
```

Note that farmhands in multiplayer can't see all locations; see
<a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_APIs_Multiplayer#GetActiveLocations"
class="wikilink"
title="GetActiveLocations"><samp>GetActiveLocations</samp></a> instead.

### Edit a location map

See <a href="Modding_Maps" class="wikilink"
title="Modding:Maps">Modding:Maps</a>.

### Position

A character's position indicates the character's coordinates in the
current location.

#### Position Relative to the Map

Each location has an \`\`xTile\`\` map where the top-left corner of the
map is *(0, 0)* and the bottom-right corner of the map is
*(location.Map.DisplayWidth, location.Map.DisplayHeight)* in pixels.

There are two ways to get a character's position in the current
location: by absolute position and by tile position.

`Position.X` and `Position.Y` will give the XY coordinates in pixels.

`getTileX()` and `getTileY()` will give the XY coordinates in tiles.

Each tile is 64x64 pixels as specified by `Game1.tileSize`. The
conversion between absolute and tile is as follows:

``` c#
// Absolute position => Tile position
Math.Floor(Game1.player.Position.X / Game1.tileSize)
Math.Floor(Game1.player.Position.Y / Game1.tileSize)

// Tile position => Absolute position
Game1.player.getTileX() * Game1.tileSize
Game1.player.getTileY() * Game1.tileSize

// Tilemap dimensions
Math.Floor(Game1.player.currentLocation.Map.DisplayWidth / Game1.tileSize)
Math.Floor(Game1.player.currentLocation.Map.DisplayHeight / Game1.tileSize)
```

#### Position Relative to the Viewport

The viewport represents the visible area on the screen. Its dimensions
are `Game1.viewport.Width` by `Game1.viewport.Height` in pixels; this is
the same as the game's screen resolution.

The viewport also has an absolute position relative to the map, where
the top-left corner of the viewport is at *(Game1.viewport.X,
Game1.viewport.Y)*.

The player's position in pixels relative to the viewport is as follows:

``` c#
Game1.player.Position.X - Game1.viewport.X
Game1.player.Position.Y - Game1.viewport.Y
```

## NPC

### Creating Custom NPCs

Adding a new NPC involves editing several files:

- New file: <a href="Modding_Dialogue" class="wikilink"
  title="Characters\Dialogue\&lt;name&gt;.json">Characters\Dialogue\&lt;name&gt;.json</a>
  (See also <a href="Modding_Event_data" class="wikilink"
  title="Modding:Event data">Modding:Event data</a>)
- New file: <a href="Modding_Schedule_data" class="wikilink"
  title="Characters\schedules\&lt;name&gt;.json">Characters\schedules\&lt;name&gt;.json</a>
  (Note that the "s" in the "schedules" folder is lowercase!)
- New file: <a href="Modding_NPC_data#Portraits" class="wikilink"
  title="Portraits\&lt;name&gt;.png">Portraits\&lt;name&gt;.png</a>
- New file:
  <a href="Modding_NPC_data#Overworld_sprites" class="wikilink"
  title="Characters\&lt;name&gt;.png">Characters\&lt;name&gt;.png</a>
- Add entries
  <a href="Modding_Dialogue#Engagement_dialogue" class="wikilink"
  title="Data\EngagementDialogue">Data\EngagementDialogue</a> for NPCs
  that are marriable
- Add entry to <a href="Modding_NPC_data#Basic_info" class="wikilink"
  title="Data\NPCDispositions">Data\NPCDispositions</a>
- Add entry to <a href="Modding_Gift_taste_data" class="wikilink"
  title="Data\NPCGiftTastes">Data\NPCGiftTastes</a>
- Add entries to
  <a href="Modding_Dialogue#Rain_dialogue" class="wikilink"
  title="Characters\Dialogue\rainy">Characters\Dialogue\rainy</a>
- Add entries to
  <a href="Modding_Schedule_data#Schedule_points" class="wikilink"
  title="Data\animationDescriptions">Data\animationDescriptions</a> (if
  you want custom animations in their schedule)

These changes can be implemented with an `AssetRequested` event or
Content Patcher. If any required data is missing or incorrect, the game
may fail to spawn the NPC without showing an error.

## User-interface (UI)

The User-interface (UI) is a collection of separate elements which make
up the HUD and occasional popups.

//TODO: This section needs to be expanded. Please contribute if you have
knowledge in this area.

### Banner message

HUDMessage are popup notifications that appear in the lower left of the
screen. There are three constructors you can use:

``` c#
  public HUDMessage(string message)
  public HUDMessage(string message, int whatType)
  public HUDMessage(string message, float timeLeft, bool fadeIn = false)
```

**A brief description of each:**

- *HUDMessage(string message)* - A notification with no icon.
- *HUDMessage(string message, int whatType)* - A notification with an
  icon depending on the type (see types below).
- *HUDMessage(string message, float timeLeft, bool fadeIn = false)* -
  Displays a message for a set amount of time and optionally will fade
  in.

<a href="File_HUDMessage-Types-InGame.png" class="wikilink"
title="200px">200px</a>

**Types available:**

1.  Achievement (HUDMessage.achievement_type)
2.  New Quest (HUDMessage.newQuest_type)
3.  Error (HUDMessage.error_type)
4.  Stamina (HUDMessage.stamina_type)
5.  Health (HUDMessage.health_type)

**Customizing a HUDMessage**

You can further customize a HUDMessage by setting its public fields to
specific values when (or after) you call the constructor.

- message - The message text to show.
- type - A key used to prevent multiple HUD messages from stacking, or
  null to use the item name.
- timeLeft - The duration in milliseconds until the message should
  disappear.
- transparency - The current opacity, from 0 (fully transparent) to 1
  (fully opaque).
- number - The count of the StardewValley.HUDMessage.messageSubject that
  was received, if applicable
- whatType - The icon to show, matching a constant like
  StardewValley.HUDMessage.error_type.
- achievement - Whether this is an achievement-unlocked message.
- noIcon - Whether to hide the icon portion of the box.
- messageSubject - The item that was received, if applicable.

**Examples**

Add a new HUDMessage to show
<a href="File_Error-image-ingame.png" class="wikilink"
title="File:Error-image-ingame.png"><span>File:Error-image-ingame.png</span></a>
toaster popup.

``` c#
Game1.addHUDMessage(new HUDMessage("MESSAGE", HUDMessage.error_type));
```

Add a HUDMessage that shows up like a simple rectangle with no icon (and
no square for an icon) and a custom duration by setting values to
specific fields:

``` c#
Game1.addHUDMessage(new HUDMessage("MESSAGE"){noIcon = true, timeLeft = 4000f});
```

For further details, refer to the `HUDMessage` class implementation.

### Active clickable menu

An *active clickable menu* is a UI drawn over everything else which
accepts user input. For example, the game menu (shown in-game when you
hit or controller ) is an active clickable menu. The menu is stored in
`Game1.activeClickableMenu`; if that field has a non-null value, the
menu will be drawn and receive input automatically.

Each menu is different, so you need to look at the menu code to know how
to interact with it. Since mods often need to get the current tab on the
game menu, here's an example which handles the map tab:

``` c#
if (Game1.activeClickableMenu is GameMenu menu)
{
  // get the tab pages
  IList<IClickableMenu> pages = this.Helper.Reflection.GetField<List<IClickableMenu>>(menu, "pages").GetValue();

  // option A: check tab ID
  if (menu.currentTab == GameMenu.mapTab)
  {
     ...
  }

  // option B: check page type
  switch (pages[menu.currentTab])
  {
    case MapPage mapPage:
       ...
       break;
  }
}
```

To create a custom menu, you need to create a subclass of
`IClickableMenu` and assign it to `Game1.activeClickableMenu`. At its
most basic, a menu is basically just a few methods you override (usually
`draw` and `receiveLeftClick` at a minimum). When `draw` is called, you
draw whatever you want to the screen; when `receiveLeftClick` is called,
you check if it's within one of the clickable areas and handle it.
Normally you'd use some convenience classes like
`ClickableTextureButton` (which has a texture and position, and
simplifies checking if they were clicked), though that's not strictly
necessary. Here's [a simple
menu](https://github.com/janavarro95/Stardew_Valley_Mods/blob/d7d567a72f5feaf3a5a5afd3d054ac9598727a97/GeneralMods/HappyBirthday/Framework/Menus/BirthdayMenu.cs)
you can use as an example, which draws the birthday menu for .

### DialogueBox

<a href="File_DialogueBox_NoChoices_Example.jpg" class="wikilink"
title="200px">200pxA</a> **DialogueBox** is a text box with a slightly
larger, slightly boldfaced text, with "typewriter-like" effect.

There are several variants, including ones with a dialogue/conversation
choices.

Within the message, use a caret "^" to put a linebreak.

Here is an example of a **simple, choiceless output:**

``` c#
using StardewValley.Menus;  // This is where the DialogueBox class lives

string message = "This looks like a typewriter ... ^But it's not ...^It's a computer.^";
Game1.activeClickableMenu = new DialogueBox(message);
```

// TODO: More examples with choices

To utilise options, you are better off using createQuestionDialogue.

``` c#
private void SampleClick()
{
    // List of choices to give the farmer.
    List<Response> choices = new List<Response>()
            {
                new Response("dialogue_id1","Choice 1" ),
                new Response("dialogue_id2", "Choice 2"),
                new Response("dialogue_id3", "Choice 3"),
                new Response("dialogue_id4", "Choice 4")
            };

    // And here we case it to pop up on the farmer's screen. When the farmer has picked a choice, it sends that information to the method below (DialogueSet
    Game1.currentLocation.createQuestionDialogue($"What is the question?", choices.ToArray(), new GameLocation.afterQuestionBehavior(DialogueSet));
}

public void DialogueSet(Farmer who, string dialogue_id)
{
    // Here you get which option was picked as dialogue_id.
    Game1.addHUDMessage(new HUDMessage($"Farmer {who} chose option {dialogue_id}"));

}
```

## Mail

If you are new to SMAPI or to modding Stardew Valley in general, sending
a simple letter to the player's mailbox is a great place to start your
learning journey. You will be treated to some simple to understand code
and concepts, as well as receive some instant gratification in the form
of a tangible, in-game letter that you can see in action. If the
examples in this section fall short, there are many folks available to
assist you on the Discord channel (//TODO: Provide link).

### Mail content

Before you can actually send any of your own custom mail to the player,
you must decided how your letter will be composed. By that I mean, is
your letter static - always the same text - or is it dynamic - text
changes based on a variable piece of information? Obviously a static
letter will be easier to implement, so if you are just starting off, go
that route for now. However, both static and dynamic methods are
explained below.

To send mail, whether static or dynamic, you first have to let Stardew
Valley know about your content, also referred to as an asset. In the
case of mail, you have to inject your additions into the mail data. You
accomplish this via the IAssetEditor interface. You can implement
IAssetEditor from your ModEntry class, or create a separate class that
implements IAssetEditor to inject new mail content into "Data\Mail.xnb".
The examples cited below use the latter approach for clarity, easy of
reuse, and encapsulation:

### Inject static content

Most times a static, predefined letter will suffice, whether you are
including an attachment (*i.e.,* object, money, etc.) or not. "Static"
simply means you do not need to change the text once it is typed before
sending the letter. A "static" letter will always be available in the
game (unless you remove it from the mod or the mod is removed by the
player) so that means the letter is still available if the player quits
with your letter still in the mailbox and then returns to play later.
This can be an issue with "dynamic" letters, as explained in more detail
in that section, so use "static" content whenever possible.

You can softly reference the player's name, using "@", but other replace
codes that may work in dialog texts, like %pet or %farm, do not work in
static mail content at this time. However, you can make use of some
special characters that display an icon in the letter, such as "=",
which will display a purple star, "\<", which will display a pink heart,
the "\$", which will be replaced with a gold coin, the "\>", which will
display a right arrow, the "\`", which will display an up arrow, and the
"+", which will display a head riding a skateboard (maybe?). There may
be additional special cases as well that are not yet documented.

The example below adds 4 letters into the mail data collection. Note,
that the code below does not send any letters to the player, but simply
makes them available to Stardew Valley game so they can be sent.

``` c#
using StardewModdingAPI;

namespace MyMod
{
    internal sealed class ModEntry: Mod
    {
        public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
        {
            helper.Events.Content.AssetRequested += this.OnAssetRequested;
        }

        private void OnAssetRequested(object? sender, AssetRequestedEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.NameWithoutLocale.IsEquivalentTo("Data/mail"))
            {
                e.Edit(this.EditImpl);
            }
        }

        public void EditImpl(IAssetData asset)
        {
            var data = asset.AsDictionary<string, string>().Data;

            // "MyModMail1" is referred to as the mail Id.  It is how you will uniquely identify and reference your mail.
            // The @ will be replaced with the player's name.  Other items do not seem to work (''i.e.,'' %pet or %farm)
            // %item object 388 50 %%   - this adds 50 pieces of wood when added to the end of a letter.
            // %item tools Axe Hoe %%   - this adds tools; may list any of Axe, Hoe, Can, Scythe, and Pickaxe
            // %item money 250 601  %%  - this sends a random amount of gold from 250 to 601 inclusive.
            // For more details, see: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Mail_data
            data["MyModMail1"] = "Hello @... ^A single carat is a new line ^^Two carats will double space.";
            data["MyModMail2"] = "This is how you send an existing item via email! %item object 388 50 %%";
            data["MyModMail3"] = "Coin $   Star =   Heart <   Dude +  Right Arrow >   Up Arrow `";
            data["MyWizardMail"] = "Include Wizard in the mail Id to use the special background on a letter";
        }
    }
}
```

### Send a letter (using static content)

Now that you have your letter loaded, it's time to send it to the
player. There are a couple different methods available to accomplish
this as well, depending on your need. Two examples are shown below. The
distinction between the two methods will be explained below:

``` c#
    Game1.player.mailbox.Add("MyModMail1");
    Game1.addMailForTomorrow("MyModMail2");
```

The first method (Game1.player.mailbox.Add) adds the letter directly
into the mailbox for the current day. This can be accomplished in your
"DayStarting" event code, for example. Mail added directly to the
mailbox is not "remembered" as being sent even after a save. This is
useful in some scenarios depending on your need.

The second method (Game1.addMailForTomorrow) will, as the name implies,
add the letter to the player's mailbox on the next day. This method
remembers the mail (Id) sent making it possible not to send the same
letter over and over. This can be handled in "DayStaring", "DayEnding"
or other events, as dictated by your need.

You may be able to put the letter directly into the mailbox and also
have it be remembered using the mailRecieved collection. You can simply
add your mailId manually if you want it to be remembered when using the
add directly to mailbox method.

If you want Stardew Valley to forget that a specific letter has already
been sent, you can remove it from the mailReceived collection. You can
iterate through the collection as well using a foreach should you need
to remove mail en mass.

``` c#
    Game1.player.mailReceived.Remove("MyModMail1");
```

That is all there is to sending a simple letter. Attaching objects and
sending money via letter is straight-forward, but sending recipes is
more complicated and will need some additional explanation at a future
time.

### Inject dynamic content

If you want to send a letter that contains data that needs to change
based on the situation, such as the number of purple mushrooms eaten
today, then you have to create that letter content each time you plan on
sending it, especially if you want an up-to-date value. That is what I
am referring to by "dynamic" letters.

Consider the following source code, which is basically an enhanced
version of the static mail class shown above, that will also support
"dynamic" content. You could certainly always use the enhanced version
of this code and just not make use of the dynamic content unless needed.
The code was separated for the purpose of illustrating the differences.

``` c#
using StardewModdingAPI;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace MyMail
{
    internal sealed class ModEntry: Mod
    {
        // This collection holds any letters loaded after the initial load or last cache refresh
        private Dictionary<string, string> dynamicMail = new();

        public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
        {
            helper.Events.Content.AssetRequested += this.OnAssetRequested;
        }

        private void OnAssetRequested(object? sender, AssetRequestedEventArgs e)
        {
             if (e.NameWithoutLocale.IsEquivalentTo("Data/mail"))
                 e.Edit(this.EditImpl);
        }

        public void EditImpl(IAssetData asset)
        {
            var data = asset.AsDictionary<string, string>().Data;

            // This is just an example
            data["StaticMail"] = "If there were any letters with static content they could be placed here.";

            // Inject any mail that was added after the initial load.
            foreach (var item in dynamicMail)
            {
                data.Add(item);
            }

            dynamicMail.Clear();    // For the usage of this MOD the letters are cleared
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Add a new mail asset into the collection so it can be injected by the next cache refresh.  The letter will
        /// not be available to send until the cache is invalidated in the code.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="mailId">The mail key</param>
        /// <param name="mailText">The mail text</param>
        public void Add(string mailId, string mailText)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(mailId))
            {
                dynamicMail[mailId] = mailText;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You will notice that there is really very little difference in the code
used for static mail and dynamic mail. The class that supports dynamic
mail has a private dictionary collection for holding on to any mail
content waiting to be injected. It could have been made public to allow
mail to be added directly into the collection, but that is not good
practice. Instead a public Add method was provided so that mail could be
sent, so to speak, to the collection. This code is for a specific MOD,
not a robust framework, so it isn't overly concerned with error
handling. You can improve that based on your needs.

Notice the additional code in the Edit method, where any mail in the
dynamicMail collection is injected into Stardew Valley's content. There
will be no mail in the dynamicMail collection when the MOD is loaded (in
this case) the first time. If you add mail after the original load, then
the content will have to be reloaded by invalidating the cache. Refer to
<a href="Modding_Modder_Guide_APIs_Content#Cache_invalidation"
class="wikilink" title="Cache invalidation">Cache invalidation</a> for
more details.

### Send a letter (using dynamic content)

You can hook into other events, such as "Day Starting" or "Day Ending"
to generate the letter you want to send. Consider this simple example,
that is only for illustration purposes.

``` c#
    private void OnDayStarting(object sender, DayStartedEventArgs e)
    {
        string mailMessage = $"@, you have gathered {Game1.stats.rabbitWoolProduced} units of rabbit wool!";

        mailData.Add("MyModMailWool", mailMessage);      // Add this new letter to the mail collection (for next refresh).

        Game1.mailbox.Add("MyModMailWool");              // Add to mailbox and we don't need to track it

        this.Helper.GameContent.InvalidateCache("Data\\mail"); // note that as of SMAPI 3.14.0, this only invalidates the English version of the asset.
    }
```

This example formats a letter, showing the up-to-date count of rabbit
wool, makes it available to the mail collection, places that letter in
the mailbox, and then invalidates the cache so that this new letter will
be injected during the cache refresh. In this case there is no need to
remember mailId as the letter will be recreated each time it needs to be
sent, which in this example is everyday. Again, this code is only for
illustration of the concept.

There is an important caveat to understand when injecting mail in this
simple fashion. The various mail frameworks available handle this issue,
and this section will be expanded to explain how to overcome the issue,
but it is being covered here to ensure you have a complete understanding
of how MODs work with Stardew Valley and SMAPI.

If you add a dynamic letter and inject it into the content at Day
Ending, you have to add the mail for display tomorrow obviously. That
means the game will be saved with a reference to the dynamic letter
("MyMailModWool" in this example) pending in the mail box. If the player
quits the game at that point and returns later to continue playing, then
that dynamic letter is not available, resulting in a "phantom letter".
The mailbox will show a letter is available but when clicked on nothing
will display. This can be handled in several ways, including by saving
the custom letters and loading them when the player continues, but again
this example code does not cover that yet. That is why the example uses
On Day Starting and makes the letter available right away.
